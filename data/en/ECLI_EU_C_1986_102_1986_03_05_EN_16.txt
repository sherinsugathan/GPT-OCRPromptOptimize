TEZI v COMMISSION

Costs

74  According to Article 69 (2) of the Rules of Procedure, the unsuccessful party must be ordered to pay the costs. Since the applicant has failed in all of its submissions, it must be ordered to pay the costs incurred by the Commission.

75 Since the Netherlands Government and the United Kingdom, which intervened in support of the Commission, have not made any claim as to costs, they must bear their own costs.


On those grounds,

THE COURT

hereby:

(1) Dismisses the application;

(2) Orders the applicant to pay the costs incurred by the Commission;

(3) Declares that the interveners shall bear their own costs.
