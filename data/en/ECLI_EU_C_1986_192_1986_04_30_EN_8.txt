ORDER OF 30. ♦. 1986 -  CASE 62/86 R

2s  Furthermore, it should be emphasized that Annex IV to the main application, relied on by the applicant, refers to transactions which took place before Decision No 85/609 entered into force.


26 It appears from the foregoing that the applicant has put forward no decisive argument showing that application of the third paragraph of Article 3 of Decision No 85/609 would cause it serious and irreparable damage.


21  Since the applicant has failed to establish the urgency required by Article 83 (2) of the Rules of Procedure, it is not necessary to consider whether the factual and legal grounds on which it relies established a prima facie case for the grant of the interim measure applied for.


On those grounds,

THE PRESIDENT,

by way of interim decision, hereby orders as follows:
(1) The application is dismissed.

(2) The costs are reserved.


Luxembourg, 30 April 1986.
