JUDGMENT OF 15.7.1960 - JOINED CASES 27 AND 39159


In his reply he contends that the action should be declared admissible and, in so far as is necessary, joined to Application No 39/59 which had been introduced sub­ sequently.

The defendant contends principally that the action should be declared to be inadmissible and, in the alternative, as to the substance of the case that the Court should rule that the application no longer served any pur­ pose and that the applicant's request for the costs to be borne by the defendant should be rejected.

In its rejoinder the defendant states that it is in agreement with the joining of Cases 27/59 and 39/59.

2. Case 39159

In his initiating application the applicant seeks the annulment, with all the legal con­ sequences in particular as regards the costs, of the decision of the President of the High Authority dated 2 July 1959 in so far as it concerns the effects of his resignation and determines his allowances on termination of service.

He also requests that this application be joined with Case 27/59.

In his reply the applicant made the follow­ ing additional conclusions:
that the High Authority be ordered to pro­ duce his personal file;

that it be declared that his resignation of 11 February 1959 took effect according to the relevant legal provisions on 12 March 1959 or, at the latest, on 11 May 1959;

that the High Authority should be obliged to grant to him pursuant to his resignation and because of the position under the Staff Regulations:

(a) 	A resettlement allowance equal to 4 times his last monthly salary;
(b) Reimbursement of travelling expenses

from Luxembourg to Brussels for him­ self and his family;

(c) The capitalized amount of the sum to his credit with the Provident Fund;

(d) The capitalized amount of the sums de­ ducted from his salary in respect of pension contributions;

(e) 	A severance grant amounting to one and a half times his last monthly salary in respect of one year and six month's service;

(0 Compensation for the eight-thirtieths of his annual leave which had not been taken by I May 1958 and reimburse­ ment for travelling expenses in respect of such leave;

(g) 5% interest, or such amount as the Court deems fit, on the _amounts pay­ able in respect of the various obligations as from 12 March 1959, or, at the latest, from 11 May 1959.

The defendant contends that the demands made in the application should be rejected and that the application should be joined to Case 27/59.

III - Submissions and arguments of the parties

The submissions and arguments of the par­ ties may be summarized as follows:
A -  Case 27 /59
1. Admissibility of the application

The defendant objects that the application is inadmissible on the ground that it was in­ troduced more than one month after notifi­ cation of the c<;>ntested decision.
