RE\l.7E v BUNDESMONOPOLVERWALTUNG FOR BRANNTI'EIN


the wishes of consumers are not m any event factors relating to public policy justifying recourse to Article 36.
Article 3 of Commission Directive No 70/50 of 22 December 1969 (Official Journal, English Special Edition 1970 (I),
 p. 17) considers as being measures having		 an			effect	equivalent			to quantitative				restrictions			on			imports, which must be abolished between the Member States, "measures governing the marketing of products which deal, in particular,			with shape, size, weight, composition, presentation, identification or putting up and which are equally applicable to domestic and imported products, where the restrictive effect of such measures on the free movement of goods exceeds the effects intrinsic to trade rules". According to			the tenth recital in the preamble to that directive, such is the case "where imports are either precluded or made more difficult or costly than the disposal of domestic production and where such effect is not necessary		for the attainment				of	an objective within the scope of the powers for the regulation of		trade left to Member States by the Treaty". The regu­ lation	on			the		minimum	wine-spirit content of potable spirits in force in Germany renders it impossible, in that country, to market and therefore to import from other Member States certain liqueurs which are known and marketed there in that form, including "Cassis de Dijon".		The		 manufacture		 of		those liqueurs in a form specifically designed for the German market would make their importation		more difficult and more costly in relation to the disposal of national products.
According to the second sentence of Article 36 of the EEC Treaty pro­ hibitions on imports shall not constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade between Member States; the Court has ruled that there is a disguised restriction within the meaning of that provision where it is established that the exercise of trademark

rights by the holder of the trademark, having regard to the marketing system operated by him, contributes to the arti­ ficial partitioning of the markets between Member States. The German regulation on the minimum wine-spirit content of potable spirits and Article 100 (3) of the Branntweinmonopolgesetz create precisely such an artificial partition between the market of the Federal Republic of Germany and the market of the other Member States; they are therefore also contrary to the second sentence of Article 36.
The first question put by the Hessisches Finanzgericht should therefore be answered as follows:
The concept of "quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect" within the meaning of Article 30 of the EEC Treaty must be interpreted as meaning that the fixing at national level of a minimum wine-spirit content for potable spirits as a condition for authorization to market within the Member State concerned, where its result is that traditional products of other Member States whose wine-spirit content is below the fixed limit cannot be put into circulation in the Federal Republic of Germany, constitutes such a measure.
(b) The second question
The second question for a preliminary ruling is put in the alternative and not as a subsidiary matter.
