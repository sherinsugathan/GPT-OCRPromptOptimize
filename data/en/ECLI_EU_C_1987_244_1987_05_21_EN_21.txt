Secondly, it was unnecessary to distribute 900 tonnes of butter free of charge in order to conduct an experiment which could have been carried ou _just as effectively by means of an opm10n survey.
The Commission points out that this alle­ gation is based on the misapprehension that the purpose of the operation is to dispose of German intervention stocks, whereas its true aim is the search for new outlets. The alle­ gation is therefore devoid of substance. The Commission adds that the choice of West

Berlin is justified by the geographical isolation of that market. If the experiment had been carried out throughout the territory of a Member State or throughout a given region, in all likelihood the product would have been purchased in considerable quantities by persons unconnected with the
Member State or the region in question. That would have affected the accuracy of the market survey. Accordingly, even if the margarine producers were to establish that the West Berlin market displayed certain atypical features, it would not follow that the decision complained of was illegal.
