and Document No 6 on the personal file).
On 23 April- 1959, the basic monthly salary of the applicant was increased to 10200 FB, corresponding to Grade CJ 10, Step 4, of the ECSC salary scale (Schedule 5 to the statement of defence), with effect from I January 1959, and on 3 July 1959 to 11475 FB, corresponding to Grade C/9, Step 3, of the same scale, with effect from 1 July 1959 (Schedule 4 to the application).
In her reply of the same date as the
letter of 3 July 1959, the applicant indicated her disagreement with the remuneration granted and tendered her resignation (Schedule 5 to the applica­ tion). It should be mentioned that this letter does not appear on the 'personal file' and that the defendant alleges that it was not received.
The defendant, recognizing that the applicant carried out tasks ofa Category B nature (Schedule 6 to the applica­ tion), informed her on 14 January 1960 that the basic monthly salary of 11475 FB, which she was receiving, corres­ ponded to Grade B 9, Step 3, of the ECSC scale (Schedule 7 to the statement of defence). In a note of 23 February 1960 addressed to the Director:.General of Administration and replying to the letter of 14 January 1960, the applicant expressed herself as follows: 'I wish, however, to repeat the reservations which I made in respect ofmy classifica­ tion and my remuneration, which do not correspond to the actual work required ofme, and would inform you that I wish to see my administrative situation regu­ larized in the near future' (Document No 16 on the personal file).
On 5 July 1960 the basic monthly salary of the applicant was increased to 12425 FB, corresponding to Grade B 8, Step 1, of the ECSC scale, with effect from I July 1960, and on 9 August 1963 to 13100 FB corresponding to Grade B 8, Step 2, of the ECSC scale, with effect from 1 July 1962 (Schedule 6 to the statement of defence and Document

In accordance with the departmental memorandum of 6 February 1962 (Schedule 20 to the statement of defence) concerning the bringing up to date of personal files with a view to integration under the Staff Regulations, the appli­ cant was asked by a stencilled letter of
