OPINION OF MR ADVOCATE-GENERAL ROEMER DELIVERED ON 10 JANUARY 1973 1


Mr President, Members of the Court,

In this reference for a preliminary ruling by the Verwaltungsgericht (Administra­ tive Court) Frankfurt which I deal with today, we are concerned with the validity of the Commission's Regulation No 1643/71 of 28 July 1971 having as its purpose 'introducing a system of minimum prices for imports of tomato concentrates from Greece' (OJ L 171, 30. 7. 1971).
In this connection, one might first of all mention the following.
Tomato concentrate under Tariff  No
20.02 is within the ambit of the common organization of the market in products processed from fruit and vegetables, created by Council Regulation No 865/68 of 28 June 1968 (OJ L 154, 1. 7.
1968). This organization of the market

provided the application of the common customs tariff in relation to third countries only, it did not however contain a protective clause, since it did not yet effect the 'coordination and unification of import regulations' which individual Member States applied towards third countries. This gap was filled by Council Regulation No 1427/71 of 2 July 1971' introducing protective measures for prod­ ucts processed from fruit and vegetables (OJ L 151, 7. 7. 1971). Article 1 provides inter alia: 'If by reason of imports the Community market in one or more of the products listed in Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 865/68 experiences or is threatened with serious disturbances which may endanger the objectives of Article 39 of the Treaty, appropriate measures may be applied in trade with third countries until such disturbances or threat of disturbance has ceased. In this respect, there was promulgated on the same day the Council Regulation No
