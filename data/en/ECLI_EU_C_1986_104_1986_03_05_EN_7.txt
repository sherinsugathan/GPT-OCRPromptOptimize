ORDER OF 5. 3. 1986 -  CASE 69/85

Costs


20 The costs incurred by the Council and the Commission of the European Communities, which have submitted observations to the Court, are not recoverable. As these proceedings are, in so far as the parties to the main action are concerned, in the nature of a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court.



On those grounds,

THE COURT,

in answer to the questions referred to it by the Verwaltungsgericht Frankfurt by order of 21 February 1985, hereby orders:

(1) The Court has no jurisdiction to give a ruling on the first three questions;

(2) There is no need to give a ruling on the fourth and fifth questions.


Luxembourg, 5 March 1986.
