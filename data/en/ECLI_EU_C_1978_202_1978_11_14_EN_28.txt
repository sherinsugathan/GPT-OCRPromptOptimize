RULING PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 103 OF THE EAEC TREATY

bution of jurisdiction and powers within the Community which the Court of Justice had occasion to emphasize in its case-law originating with the judgment of 31 March 1971 (Case 22/70 Commission v Council [ 1971] 1 ECR 263 on the European agreement on road transport). The structure of the EAEC Treaty, contemplated in this spirit, will make it possible for all the responsibilities arising for the Community from the draft convention to be met.
On those grounds, THE COURT,
adjudicating upon the application from the Government of the Kingdom of Belgium under Article 103 of the EAEC Treaty, hereby rules as follows:

1. 	The participation of the Member States in a convention relating to the physical protection of nuclear materials, facilities and transports such as the convention at present being negotiated within the Inter­ national Atomic Energy Agency is compatible with the provisions of the EAEC Treaty only subject to the condition that, in so far as· its own powers and jurisdiction are concerned, the Community as su'ch is a party to the convention on the same lines as the States.

2. 	The fulfilment of the obligations entered into under the convention is to be ensured, on the Community's part, in the context of the institutional system established by the EAEC Treaty in ·accordance with the distribution of powers between the Community and its Member States.
