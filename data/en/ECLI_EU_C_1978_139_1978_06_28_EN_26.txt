11 January 1973, Simmenthal S.p.A., the Plaintiff in the proceedings before the Pretore, imponed consignments of Uruguyan frozen beef into Italy. It cleared them through customs at Alessandria. Pursuant to Anicle 32 of

the Italian Statute of 27 July 1934 consolidating Italian public health legislation (the "testo unico delle leggi sanitarie", G.U. No 186 of 9 August 1934, the beef was subjected, on its arrival in Italy, to veterinary inspection. For such inspections charges were pres­ cribed  by  Statute  No  1239  of
30 December 1970 (G.U. No 26 of 1 February 1971). They amounted to Lit 128 370 for the first consignment and to Lit 186 775 for the second.
