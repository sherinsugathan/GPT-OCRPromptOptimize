JUDGMENT OF 10. 7. 1986 -  CASE 151/85

(1) 	Where meat is delivered frozen to the place of storage, it does not constitute 'fresh or chilled' meat within the meaning of Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 805/68 of the Council of 27 June 1968, and hence cannot qualify for the private-storage aid provided for by that article.	-

(2) 	It is not compatible with the rules of Community law governing private-storage aid for beef and veal for the steps preparatory to storage, in particular the freezing of the meat, to he carried out at a place other than the place of actual storage.
