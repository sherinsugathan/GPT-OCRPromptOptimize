OPINION OF MR ADVOCATE-GENERAL DUTHEILLET DE LAMOTHE DELIVERED ON 3 FEBRUARY 19711

Mr President,
Members of the Court,

This is one of those cases where we all feel the obligation, regretfully, to con­ sider the merits of the application solely from the legal ,point of view.
Mr Marcato is a deserving man.


Engaged by the Communities to per­ form almost exclusively manual work, he succeeded through hard work and ,,i energy in becoming a qualified techni­ cian in a particularly difficult field, that of computers, having been a punched­ card operator at .the Centre in Brussels since 1963.
