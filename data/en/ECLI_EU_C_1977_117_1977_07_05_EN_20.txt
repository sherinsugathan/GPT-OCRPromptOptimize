JUDGMENT OP S. 7. 1977 - CASE 116/76

26  In consequence, the answer must be that Council Regulation (EEC) No 563/76 of 15 March 1976 is null and void.

27  In view of this reply, there is no need to consider the questions submitted by the College van Beroep in so far as they refer to rules of Community law other than those treated above.


Costs

2s The costs incurred by the Council and the Commission of the European Communities, which have submitted observations to the Court, are not recoverable.

29 As these proceedings are, in so far as the parties to the main action are concerned, a step in the action pending before the national court, costs are a matter for that court.
On those grounds, THE COURT,

in answer to the questions referred to it by the College van Beroep voor het Bedrijfsleven, by order of 7 December 1976 hereby rules:

Council Regulation (EEC) No 563/76 of 15 March 1976 on the compulsory  purchase  of  skimmed-milk  powder  held  by in ervention agencies for use in feeding-stuffs is null and void.
