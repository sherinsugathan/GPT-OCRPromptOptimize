SPJJKER v COMMISSION

11  In those circumstances the contested decision cannot be challenged by the applicant under the second paragraph of Article 173 of the Treaty. Furthermore, that conclusion is consistent with the scheme of remedies provided for by Community law since the importers in question have the right to challenge before the national courts the refusal on the part of the national authorities, based on the application of Community law, to grant an import licence.


12	For all those reasons the application must be declared inadmissible.


Costs

13  Under Article 69 (2) of the Rules of Procedure the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs. As the applicant has failed in its submissions it must be ordered to pay the costs.


On those grounds,


THE COURT (Third Chamber) hereby:
1. Dismisses the application as inadmissible;

2. Orders the applicant to pay the costs.
