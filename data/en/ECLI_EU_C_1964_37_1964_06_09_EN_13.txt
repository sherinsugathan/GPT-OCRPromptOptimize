JUDGMENT OF 9.6.1964-JOINED CASES 55 TO 59/63 AND 61 TO 63/63


the better to demonstrate that such a defect exists in its case.
The High Authoriry replies, in Case 57/63, that this contrary view is based on the false assumption that Decision No 7/63 is similar to the report of the liquidator of a private company. In this latter case it is obvious that each member has the right to know the financial position of the others, whereas in the present case each undertaking subject to the equali­ zation scheme must itself prove any mistakes which may have been made relating to itself. Apart however from the obligation of professional secrecy it must not be forgotten that the High Authority is a public body and as such its acts are presumed to be in com­ pliance with the law.
With regard to the duty to state reasons, this is confined to a statement in abstract terms of the reasons upon which the contested Decision is based and need not, as the applicant main­ tains, include an individual account. In addition the statement of all the factors used in the calculations, which have been ascertained or evaluated, is inadmissible not only in the case of the contested Decision but also in the case of the individual decisions which will be taken, when the time comes, against defaulting undertakings; this is all the more so because it is not clear how the various factors upon which the calcula­ tions and the total results have been based could have been brought in practice to the notice of the under­ takings.
In the other cases the High Authoriry main­ tains in addition that, since a general decision is concerned in this case, the reasons for it cannot include factors which must be mentioned in the indivi­ dual decisions which will have to be taken at a later date. After mentioning the reasons why the relationship con­ sumption of electricity/scrap purchased should be regarded as correct and the pro­ cedure whereby the provisional com­ putations were made in the case of undertakings which did not comply

with the order to submit their invoices for consumption of electricity, it states that the provisional nature of certain provisions in Decision No 7/63 and the amount of the equalization rate is due to the fact that the determination of the basis for assessment has not yet been fixed: this situation does not necessarily call for a statement of reasons.
Finally in all the cases the High Authoriry observes that the equalization rate has not in fact been increased by the con­ tested Decision, as the rate in question includes, in addition to the various amounts required for the operation of the equalization scheme, the interest payable by undertakings which did not pay it on the dates laid down for that purpose. It concludes that in such cir­ cumstances it was quite unnecessary for the contested Decision to explain this point, and there can be no question of any delay in the determination of the new rate.

4. Infringement of the law: incompati­ biliry with Communiry rules relating to publication of prices

The applicants argue that Decision No 7/63, instead of fixing a rate which, even if only provisional, ought to have been based on established facts, subject of course to the necessary adjustments, adopted new criteria for sharing the equalization charges and claim that this change is so substantial that it is not one of the factors which could reasonably have been foreseen by the undertakings when they determined their prices and made public the price lists referred to in Article 60 (2) of the Treaty.
The argument continues: it is useless to invoke the principle upheld by the Court of Justice that the requirement of legal certainty must to some extent give way to the necessity that the equaliza­ tion scheme must be operated, because this principle was upheld subject to the reservation that the producers con­ cerned must be enabled to take account of possible increases in the equalization
