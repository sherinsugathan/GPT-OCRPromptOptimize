JUDGMENT OF 29. 11. 1984 -  CASE 265/83


27 Under the first subparagraph of Article 69 (2) of the Rules of Procedure the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been asked for in the successful party's pleading.

1. Annuls the Commission's decision of 3 February 1983 in so far as it establishes an aggregate permanent partial invalidity rate of less than 37.25%, in so far as it fixes a date earlier than 18 May 1979 as that of the consolidation of the sequelae of the accident and in so far as it claims the repayment of the benefits relating thereto;

2. Dismisses the remainder of the application;

3. Orders the Commission to pay the costs.
