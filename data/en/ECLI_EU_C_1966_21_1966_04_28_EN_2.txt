JUDGMENT

Issues of fact and of law


I -  Facts

The facts may be summarized as follows: By letterof 8 April 1963, the High Authority informed the ILFO company that the amount of assessable ferrous scrap con­ sumed by the undertaking had been esti­ mated at 29 958 metric tons and called upon it to pay the sum of 196197166 lire by way of equalization.
The applicant challenged this letter and basic Decision No 7/63 before the Court of Justice. The Application in Case 61/63 was dismissed by the Court as inadmissible by Judgment of 9 June 1964.
In the light of the observations of the appli­ cant and the documents produced by it in the course of the proceedings, the High Authority made a further review of the quantities of scrap assessable. As a result of these checks and by applying the indirect method of calculation based upon the con­ sumption of electricity, it adopted,· on 19 May 1965, two individual decisions one of which estimates the quantity of assessable scrap at 26 532 metric tons, whilst the other fixes the amount of the corresponding con­ tribution at 176 080 828 lire.
These two decisions, which were notified to the ILFO company on 24 June 1965, form the subject of the present application.
II -  Conclusions of the parties The applicant claims that the Court should:

'(a) Exercise the powers conferred on it by Article 33 of the Treaty in order to annul the two individual decisions of 19 May 1965 and, in addition, in so far as it deems it appropriate, Decision No 7/63 to which the individual decisions refer;
(b) Exercise the powers conferred on it by Article 34 of the Treaty to refer the matter back to the High Authority for it to take the necessary steps to comply with the judgment, including the re­ imbursement of any sum paid in error and the payment of such damages as the Court shall see fit;
(c) 	Order the High Authority to pay the costs;
(d) 	Make interlocutory orders for the con­ duct of the measures of inquiry indica­ ted in each submission.'
The defendant contends that the Court should:
'Take into account the fact that the metric tonnage of assessable scrap has been re­ duced to 24 979 metric tons and the total of the sums owed by the ILFO company to 171765 956 lire, dismiss the application against the two individual decisions of 19 May 1965 and order the applicant to pay the costs.'
