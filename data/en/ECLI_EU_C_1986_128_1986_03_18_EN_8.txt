JUDGMENT OF 18. 3. 1986 -  CASE 58/85

23	The third question, which was raised in case the second question was answered in the affirmative, is therefore irrelevant.


Costs

2• The costs incurred by the Council and by the Commission of the European Communities, which have submitted observations to the Court, are not recoverable. Since these proceedings are, in so far as the parties to the main proceedings are concerned, in the nature of a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court.



On those grounds,

THE COURT (Third Chamber),

in answer to the questions submitted to it by the Bundesfinanzhof by order of 24 January 1985, hereby rules:

(1) The description 'yam wholly of polyglycollic acid' ex subheading 51.01 A of the Common Customs Tariff contained in Council Regulation No 1162/79 of 12 June 1979 and No 1481/80 of 9 June 1980 does not cover yarn composed of both polyglycollic acid and lactic acid, even if the 100/o of lactic acid which it contains does not affect the properties or use of that product.

(2) Consideration of the questions raised has disclosed no factor of such a nature as to affect the validity of Regulations Nos 1162/79 and 1481/80 as regards the suspension of duties in question.
