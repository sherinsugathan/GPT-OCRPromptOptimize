JUDGMENT OF I. 2. 1979 -  CASE 121/78

29 As these proceedings are, in so far as the parties to the main action are concerned, in the nature of a step in the action pending before the Pretura di Cecina, the decision as to costs is a matter for that court.
On those grounds,

THE COURT,
in answer to the questions referred to it by the Pretura di Cecina by an order of 13 May 1978, hereby rules:

Under Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2902/77 of 22 December 1977 fixing the quantity of young male bovine animals which may be imported on special terms in the first quarter of 1978 the Member States concerned, and more particularly the Italian Republic, were entitled to specify the categories of agricultural producers who might benefit from the import quota of young male bovine animals under partial or total suspension of the levy within the framework of a policy intended to help improve cattle rearing and beef and veal production structures.

To allow only farmers practising farming as their main occQpation so to benefit is in accordance with the obligations on the Member States arising from Council Directive No 72/159 of 17 April on the moderni­ zation of farms.
