FIVES LILLE CAIL v HIGH Al'TIIORITY


 The applicants further maintain that transport parity is in the interest of the general public, which bears the excess of the purchase price of imported scrap and scrap treated as such including shipyard scrap, over the equalization prices. During the whole equalization period, the cost price of shipyard scrap, on rail ex scrap recovery yard was markedly lower than the cost price of scrap imported by sea cif the port of entry; it was therefore in the interest of the public to purchase all available supplies of shipyard scrap. The effect, therefore, of the undertakings entered into by the OCCF was to reduce the burden of equalization and to prevent the export of amounts of scrap at prices which were especially favourable to consumers as a whole; these undertak­ ings fulfilled one of the fundamental objectives of the Treaty, which is to en­ sure the establishment of the lowest prices in accordance	with Article 3(c).
In its reply, the defendant states that the applicants' view is based on mis­ interpretation of the fundamental provisions of the Treaty governing equal access and non-discrimination. It presupposes that natural differences produced by geographical location are compensated for by artificial means; to introduce into the equalization scheme a formula for geographical correcting factors based on the distance between undertakings and their centres of supp­ ly would be to adopt an attitude which is in every respect alien to the fun­ damental principles of the Treaty.
The applicants' reply to this is that the High Authority has, in the case of ferrous scrap, nevertheless allowed differences arising from geographical location to be redressed by adding $2 to the equalization price of scrap ac­ cording to whether or not imports entered over land or by water; the feasibility of making such imports is es­ sentially dependent on geographical cir­ cumstances.

(d) (i) The defendant contends that there can be no doubt about the legality of the procedure for recovering un­ lawful payments when it is borne in mind that the equalization scheme is based on principles of public law and when account is taken of the necessarily provisional nature of the amounts paid under this financial machinery. It denies that the provisional nature of the state­ ments of account is as unimpor­ tant as the applicants claim. It goes without saying that material errors are always subject to amendment; to describe a discount as only provisional implies that it is subject to further adjustments going beyond mere material amendments, for example adjust­ ments arising from the fact that the initial calculation took account of factors which ought to have been ignored. Of course, the provisional nature of the state­ ments of account obviously does not constitute authority for altera­ tions in the principles themselves, but the decisions concerning repayment which are complained of entail no alteration in the prin­ ciples which the High Authority claims to have previously accepted.
(ii) The defendant contests, as regards the effect in law of errors which it holds to be open to amendment, in particular those concerning the applicants in Joined Cases 2 and 3/61, that the fact that it included the transport parity refund in the applicants' first statement of ac­ count and subsequently in certain fresh amended statements, can be interpreted as meaning that it thereby decided to accept the ac­ tual principle of reimbursement and to confirm the agreements and undertakings entered into earlier by the OCCF; in its view, it only intended to take an implementing
