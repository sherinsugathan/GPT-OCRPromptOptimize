Costs

The costs incurred by the Government of the Italian Republic and by the Commission of the European Communities, which have submitted obser­
,·ations to the Court, are not recoverable.

As these proceedings are, so far as the parties to the main action are concerned, in the nature of a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court.


On those grounds,


THE COURT,

in answer to the question referred to it by the Cour d'Appel, Douai, by a. judgment of 10 October 1978, hereby rules:

Articles 2 (1 ), 3 (1) and 4 (1) (c) and (2) of Regulation No 1408/71 must be interpreted as meaning that the grant of a non-contributory old-age benefit to women with children may not be made', dependent either on the nationality of the person concerned or on that of her children, provided that the nationality in question is that of. one of the Member States.
