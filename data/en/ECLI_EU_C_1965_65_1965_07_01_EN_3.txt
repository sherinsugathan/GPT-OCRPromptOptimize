TOEPFER v COMMISSION


larger undertakings in ithis area of trade in me Federal Republic.
The manze imported init:o the Federal Republic comes partly from France. The trade between these il'Wo countries comes under the provisions of Regulation No 19 of the O:mncil of the EEC on the progressive establishment of a common organization of tlhe market in cereals (Official Journal, 1962, ip. 933/62).
The Regulation makes the import of maize subject to the paymenit under certain circumstances of a levy result­ ing from the difference between the threshold price and the free-at-frontier price fixed by the O:>mmission for the exporting country.
The levy is calculated and collected by the national customs authorities, in this case by the 'Eimuhr- und Vorratsstelle fur Getreide und Futtermittel' (herein­ after referred to as ',tlhe E.V.G.'), a body governed by German public law which pu!blishes the raites of levy by posting notices in the building of its headquarters at Frankfort and which issues import licences on demand. These licences amount to an 'authority to import'.
The E.V.G., in application of rthe 3!bovementioned Regulation, posted a notice fixing a zero levy for 1 October 1963, and on ,the same day the appli­ cants asked for impott licences for the monith of January with advance fixing of tlhe levy at zero.
The applicant in Case 106/63 asked for licences for a total of 24 000 metric tons, and the applicant in Case 107/ 63 for a total of 21 200 metric itons. It emerges from ,the file thait the total of requests for import licences lodged on
1 October for ,the month of January came to 126 000 metric tons.
The E.V.G. did not issue the licences requested, basing its decision on certain protective measures taken by the Federal Goverll!IIleOlt as provided for in Article 22 of Regulation No 19.
By a decision taken on 1 October, the Commission of the EEC fixed a new


free-at-lronrtlier price for maize imported into the Federal Republic as from 2 October.
Furthermore the Official Journal of the European Communities of 11 October 1963 (p. 2479/63) published itlhe Com­ mission's decision of 3 October by which it retroactively authorized the Federal Republic to maintain the pro­ tecti.ve measure taken by 11:he Federal GovernmeOlt until 4 October inclusive. On 20 December 1963 the two under­ takings initiated proceedings for the annulment of the said decision of 11:he Commission.
