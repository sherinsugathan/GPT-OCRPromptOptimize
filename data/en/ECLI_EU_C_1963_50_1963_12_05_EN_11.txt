JUDGMENT OF 5. 12. 1963 - JOINED CASES 35/62 AND 16/63

Under the terms of the second subparagraph of Article 69 (3) of those Rules, the Court may order even a successful party to pay costs which the Court considers that party to have unreasonably caused the opposite party to incur.
The conduct of the defendant has encouraged the applicant to bring two applications, whereas if the letter of 5 September 1962 had been drafted less equivocally a single application would have been sufficient.
However, once the formal decision contested in Application 16/63 had been taken, the applicant should have realized that he had no grounds for proceed­ ing with Application 35/62 from which it would have been reasonable for him to withdraw.
In these circumstances it is appropriate that the applicant's costs be borne as stated in the operative part of the judgment.

On those grounds,

Upon reading the pleadings;
Upon hearing the report of the Judge-Rapporteur; Upon hearing the parties;
Upon hearing the opinion of the Advocate-General;
Having regard to the Protocol on the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Coal and Steel Community;
Having regard to the Staff Regulations of the European Coal and Steel Community;
Having regard to the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice of the European Communities;

THE COURT (First Chamber) hereby:
1. 	Dismisses Application 35/62 as inadmissible and Application 16/63 as unfounded;
2. 	Orders the applicant to pay his own costs incurred in Application 35/62 after notification of the decision of the President of the IHiigh Authority of 11 October 1962, the remaining costs of the application and the costs incurred by the defendant being borne by that party;
3. Orders the applicant to pay the costs of Application 16/63, the costs incurred by the defendant being home by that party.
