ORDER

lFects

On 15 December 1961 the Court delivered judgment in Joined Cases 19/60, 21/60, 2/61 and 3/61.
On 28 December 1961, the applicants submitted an application for rectifica­ tion of this judgment under Article 66 of the Rules of Procedure; they claim therein that the concluding paragraphs of the grounds of judgment contain an obvious slip in that the Court did not allow  the applicants'  damage to be

assessed at the amounts of the transport parities and rules that the damage was not established.

In observations submitted on 16 January 1962, the defendant, the High Authority, contends that the Court should declare the application for rec­ tification inadmissible or, in any case, dismissed, with all legal consequences in respect of the costs of the,proceedings.





Gll'oumds

Article 66 of the Rules of Procedure provides as follows:

'l. Without prejudice to the provisions relating to the interpretation of judgments the Court may, of its own motion or on application by a party made within two weeks after the delivery of a judgment, rectify clerical mistakes, errors in calculation and obvious slips in it.'

This provisiol'l refers, as a possible ground for rectification, to purely material errors in a judgment in cases where no difficulty arises concerning the meaning or scope of the decision. Rectification within the meaning of Article 66 of the Rules of Procedure cannot purport to amend or revise a previous decision.
