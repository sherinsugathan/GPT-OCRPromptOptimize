REPORT FOR THE HEARING -  CASE 300/84


That interpretation is confirmed both by the very.terms of Article 2 (4) of Regulation No 1390/81 and by the Court's case-law, particularly the judgment of 10 June 1982 (Case 92/81 Caracciolo v INAMI [1982] ECR 2213). Since the Court considered that Article 10 of Regulation No 1408/71 provided inter alia for the waiving of residence clauses which were a condition for the award of benefits, then, a .fortiori, the same must be true of clauses requiring the insured person to stay for a specified period on the territory of a Member State, since the obligation to reside in a certain Member State in order to be eligible for certain benefits is in fact more severe than the obli­ gation merely to stay there.
